# Systems Selection

## Deliverable

## Scenario & Problem Domain

You team is tasked with updating the core IT infrastructure of a recent client company acquisition. This young, innovative startup aligns well with the mission of the client company; unfortunately, its IT systems are not yet integrated into the corporate domain and cloud infrastructure.

Your team has been assigned to prototype the process of integrating these new companies. You will need to set up a VPC and Windows Server in AWS to represent existing Globex infrastructure, then practice the process of adding and organizing the new employees in Active Directory, securely connecting the acquisition's office network to the VPC, connecting local endpoints to the domain, and configuring a captive portal on a local router authenticate using Active Directory.

Remember, the purpose of this project is to **demonstrate a repeatable, efficient system** for integrating new acquisitions, not just to show off the technology itself.

Your instructor will play the role of the operations manager who has tasked you with this project, and will send you a detailed list of technical requirements.
