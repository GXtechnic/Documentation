Group Project: Team Agreement
The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.
Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.
Planning
Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.
Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.
Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to schedule a “practice run” of your presentation.
Plan for a 45-60 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team. During the practice presentation, the instructional team will provide constructive feedback about the flow of the presentation and technical demo.
Your team should practice the presentation prior to rehearsals with the instructional team.
Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel. Remember, “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
Why:
If there are any issues in your final product’s functionality, it is better to catch them ahead of time. This is also an opportunity to view the technical demonstration as it will be shared with the audience. Evaluate any screen size issues, color changes due if you are projecting, and overall impact on the user’s experience. The practice round will also allow the team to work on the flow of the presentation as speaking roles are passed from one member to another.
Decide whose computer to use during the presentation and have that computer fully ready for the practice session. Make sure you have any cables or adaptors needed, and know what settings are needed to share your screen (and audio, if relevant). Test this computer as the driver of the presentation BEFORE your practice. Test a backup computer as well, just in case.
The appropriate dress code is business casual - not too formal and not too casual.
In addition to the scheduled practice session, the team is encouraged to continue to practice on their own. Keep track of the time and adjust accordingly. Practice with the microphone (muting / unmuting, or holding something if in-person) to feel comfortable with it, and practice passing the microphone between team members as you switch speaking roles if in-person.
Speak clearly and do not use slang or profanity. Take it seriously and be professional.

Mack Dirks
I am success driven, willing to go the extra mile to help my team succeed, and deliver the best product.
Ben Hobbs
I can address anything our team needs. I’m good at getting out of my comfort zone to stretch myself and grow more. The strengths I have I think can be applied toward presenting, creating docs/repos/topologies/etc., and talking out concepts to brainstorm with my team.
Justin Dotson
Can Pivot when problems arise and fill in areas that may need additional work
Marcelo Clark
These skills will lead to strong cohesion between myself and my team mates. I will be on time, helpful, and determined to get my part of the project done so that we can have the best project possible. Listening will let me take consideration from other team mates and implement any solutions that any one comes up with.
Raphael Chookagian
I have experience using many of the programs we will be using for the presentation and task completions.

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Mack Dirks
I want to develop my skills in coding, as well as using technical assets.
Ben Hobbs
I want to develop more (specifically) in the professional competencies of: Craft (Coding, GitHub), Judgment, and Results.
Justin Dotson
Coding
Marcelo Clark
I would like to improve my networking and technical skills.
Raphael Chookagian
I would like to improve my communication and networking.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Mack Dirks
By creating a clear and concise outline and following that throughout the project. As well as holding each other accountable to the set standard.
Ben Hobbs
Keeping open communication with everyone so that we neither duplicate efforts or allow anything to fall through the cracks.
Justin Dotson
Keep to agreed hours and work extra if unexpected things come up.
Marcelo Clark
I plan on communicating with my teammates so that everyone is on track as to what they are doing. We will use the slack messenger app and remo to hash out any problems or come up with solutions.
Raphael Chookagian
I have found that it is best if everyone works together from the beginning and keeps pace throughout the project. Stand-ups each morning should set the tone and pace for the day with clear goals and tasks to complete for the day.

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.
Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
Describe at least:
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Maintain clear and concise communication. Will discuss areas of friction promptly. Resolve in 5-10min.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Bring it up to the individual.
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Life happens, reinforce communication strategy. Use our tech to be accessible. Can address updates at daily standup.
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Discuss.  Ask questions, don’t assume.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
Maintain respect and professionalism. Use this opportunity to refine conflict resolution skills.
Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
Describe at least:
What hours will you be available to communicate?
9am - 4pm (M-F) available via Slack.  Case-by-Case
What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, Discord …)?
Slack , REMO, Zoom, Trello
How often will you take breaks?
15 minutes every hour.
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Reach out! Tell someone, request assistance.
How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Slack
What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Morning stand-ups share thoughts. Open forum.
How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
We will work collaboratively and follow the above plan.
Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, building or making changes to the project infrastructure on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
Describe at least:
How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
We will work collaboratively and follow the above plan. We will as a group take a look at the task list when it is given to us. Then as a group we will be able to identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work.  Will remain flexible to changes, areas of conflict,
What project management tool will be used?
Trello Workplace Board
Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for scripting tasks.
Describe at least:
What components of your project will be recorded in a Google Doc?
All of the prep assignments will be recorded in Google Docs.
What components of your project will live on GitHub?
All of our code, README’s and any other information will be on Github.
How will you structure the GitHub organization and the repos inside of it?
We will have each section organized with its own Repo and folder/directory tree.
How will you share the organization and the repositories with your teammates?
All members will be added to the Organization as Admins/Full control.
What is your Git flow? How will you commit your work to GitHub?
We will have a “merge party” during standups in the morning and will plan for another towards the end of day.
