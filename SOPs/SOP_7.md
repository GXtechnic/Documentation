<br>

## Procedure

**Network Design and Configuration**

* Design the architecture based on end-user needs, budget, and any other relevant considerations (initial network architecture diagram illustrated below)

* Implement port and firewall configuration on all networked devices ([see network connectivity guide - Lab 7](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VLcArFshXQOc83mTYLSrvzxAdJV0QGRttbriUhKnJd8/edit#heading=h.euyi6w8xahvc))
