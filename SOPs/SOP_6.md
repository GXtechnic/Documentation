# How will you manage change to the network (such as hardware, software, or configuration changes) while minimizing network disruptions and downtime?

<br>

## Purpose

* This SOP is to establish and ensure consistent and efficient troubleshooting practices to resolve technical issues effectively.

<br>

## Scope

* Troubleshooting and resolving technical problems reported by users or identified through proactive monitoring.

<br>

## Responsibilities

* The IT department is responsible for the implementation, maintenance and review of this policy.

<br>

## Procedure

<br>

**Initial Information Gathering**

* Obtain a detailed description of the issue from the user.

* Ask specific questions to identify the symptoms, affected systems, and recent changes.

* Document all relevant information in the ticketing system or a dedicated troubleshooting log.

<br>

**Problem Reproduction**

* Attempt to reproduce the reported issue in a controlled environment if possible.

* Document the steps taken to reproduce the problem and any observed error messages or abnormal behavior.

<br>

**Root Cause Analysis**

* Start with the most common and likely causes based on the symptoms reported.

* Use a systematic approach to narrow down potential causes, ruling out possibilities one by one.

* Review system logs, error messages, and event histories for additional clues.

* Utilize diagnostic tools and software to identify potential hardware or software failures.

* Consult relevant documentation, knowledge bases, and vendor resources for known issues and resolutions.

<br>

**Troubleshooting Steps**

* Develop a step-by-step plan for troubleshooting based on the identified potential causes.

* Document each step and the corresponding results or outcomes.

* Test proposed solutions in a controlled environment before implementing them in the production environment.

* Apply changes and solutions in a controlled and documented manner, minimizing any potential disruptions.

<br>

**Solution Implementation and Validation**

* Implement the selected solution based on the troubleshooting outcome.

* Verify the effectiveness of the solution by testing the affected systems or applications.

* Confirm with the user that the issue is resolved and their expectations are met.

* Document the final solution and any configuration changes made.
